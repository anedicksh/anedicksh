#Hi there 👋

I am a Data Scientist. I decided to pursue a master's degree in Applied Data Science in the Netherlands because I am fascinated by the diverse ways it can be applied to inform decision-making in various industries, and improve people's lives. I am seeking to combine my technical and analytical skills to excel in the wonderful field of Data Science.
